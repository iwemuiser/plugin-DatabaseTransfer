DatabaseTransfer - A MySQL table import plugin for Omeka

I works pretty much the same as the CsvImport plugin. 
First you have to supply it with login information for the sql database you want to access. 
After this it is possible to select the table to be imported. 
The next step is an expanded version of the CsvImport plugin's mapping form. 
Additionally it is possible to split values by a delimiter character.

The undo function also works.
